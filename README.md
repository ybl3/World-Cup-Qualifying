# World-Cup-Qualifying
Simulator for FIFA World Cup Qualifying

Includes the 2026 World Cup Qualifying format for all 6 confederations

Can simulate each confederation separately, or all at once

Can change a team's confederation by using the focuses feature in main.py

Final data includes successful qualifications for each team, for each confederation (out of 100 sims)
Note that the USA, Canada, and Mexico will qualify as hosts everytime, so subtract 100 out of their qualifications for each confederation

output.txt and output1.txt show the results of two different full simulations

can use either datacurrent.csv or dataprevious.csv for initial data (current includes current FIFA Rankings, previous has Summer 2023 rankings which is more similar to what was used in reality)
